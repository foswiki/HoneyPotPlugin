---+!! Honey Pot Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

Public wiki sites are often plagued with spammers and other unwelcome visitors,
such as search engine indexers that can suck the life out of an otherwise
fast site.

[[http://www.projecthoneypot.org][Project HoneyPot]] has been set up to 
record data about IP addresses that constitute a threat to websites, either
because they are an excessive drain on the resources of the sites
or because they are known sources of spam.

This plugin checks incoming requests against the honeypot database and
rejects operations from IP addresses found there.

The admin has full control over the operations that are checked, and the
nature of the checks. Configuration is done using the =%SCRIPTURL{configure}%=
interface.

---++ REST handler
The plugin also publishes a REST handler that can be used to check an IP
address against the database. The handler is called =check= and is passed
the parameters =ip= (the IP address to check) and =tests= (a comma-separated
list of tests to perform). If any of the tests fails, the handler will respond
with a 403 (forbidden) with the name of the failing test in the response body.
For example,
<verbatim>
http://my.foswiki/rest/HoneyPotPlugin/check?ip=12.34.56.78&tests=is_search_engine,is_harvester
</verbatim>
A description of the available tests can be found at http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Honeypot-httpBL/lib/WWW/Honeypot/httpBL.pm

---++ API
There is also an API that other plugins can use when this plugin is loaded:

=Foswiki::Plugins::HoneyPotPlugin::check($domain, $tests) -> $result=
   * =$domain= - domain name or IP address to check
   * =$tests= - either an array of predicate names or a comma-separated
     string list of predicates to perform e.g. 'is_comment_spammer,is_search_engine'
